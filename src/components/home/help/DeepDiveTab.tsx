                After generating a palette, you can fine-tune it. Open the palette details to see

                Start to explore how different shades of the palette will look in light and dark

                automatically, using perceptual measures of contrast and luminance. When you like
                the result, you can copy the TypeScript code and add directly to your ChakraUI React

                    When adjusting saturation or contrast, you might see a "!" warning icon. This
                    indicates that your adjustments have pushed the color beyond normal limits,
                    potentially causing "color clipping" where details are lost in extremely light
                    or dark areas.

                  <Text fontSize="xs" mt={1}>
                    To resolve this, try reducing the intensity of your adjustment or start with a
                    different base color. For best results, keep your adjustments within ranges that
                    don&apos;t trigger the warning indicator.

                Accessibility is more than just a buzzword. It's a hard requirement of websites

              </Text>
              <Text mb={3}>
                Accessibility in selecting colors for a website means choosing color combinations
                that ensure sufficient contrast and visibility for all users, including those with
                visual impairments, to easily read and navigate the content.{" "}

                </Link>
                . That standard has two measures, AA and AAA: 10/10 is a good score for AA with its
                4.5:1 contrast ratio, and 8/10 is not bad for AAA, with its more stringent
                requirements of 7:1.

                Then see how the contrast between adjacent shades fares. The adjacent shade contrast
                display shows the perceptual contrast ratio between neighboring shades in your color
                palette, with higher numbers and green badges indicating good differentiation
                between consecutive shades, while lower numbers and red badges suggest shades that
                might be too similar for effective visual hierarchy.

                Color blindness is an issue for many people. People affected with color blindness
                often identify pastel shades of color pairs like red/green and green/brown as being
                too similar. (Try not to ask a color-blind person what color they see instead.

                The three main types of color blindness are protanopia (difficulty distinguishing
                red), deuteranopia (difficulty distinguishing green), and tritanopia (difficulty
                distinguishing blue), each resulting from missing or defective cone cells in the
                retina that detect those specific wavelengths of light.
